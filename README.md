# Meeter

Meeter is a (basic) ~hack~ application, to automatically attend to meetup events.

## How it works
1) change the configuration part.
2) login to meetup and press "start".
3) wait until it has finished.

## Caveats
This is a very basic application, and it has no error handling. It will just keep on going until it has finished. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
